### Description
Repository describes the analysis pipeline used for my ongoing analysis of West Nile virus in the United States.
Primarily we're interested in the environmental, ecological, and viral factors that drive intermittent seasonal outbreaks.

The primary analysis pipeline is provided as a snakemake pipeline in the `workflow` directory. 
Additional details there describe the pipeline in greater depth. 
Input files for the pipeline, representing an up-to-date alignment and metadata, are present in the `input` directory.
Additional files and data, either generated by the pipeline or necessary for analyses, are provided in the `data` folder.
Though some files may not be present at the moment due to unclear licenses.
Complete analyses and figures are in the `analysis` directory.
